The Fifth Conference of the School of Mamluk Studies, which will be held at Ghent University (Belgium) from July 5-7, 2018.

The conference website at <http://www.sms2018.ugent.be/> may sometimes be more current, so be sure to check there for updates to the program or further information about travel, accommodations, etc.

The conference will be conducted in two parts and will be preceded by a three-day intensive course on Digital Islamic Humanities from July 2-4, 2018.

The three-day intensive course in Digital Islamic Humanities is intended for advanced graduate students and other qualified participants. It will be offered by [Dr Maxim Romanov](https://maximromanov.github.io/) (Universität Wien) and will be held immediately before the fifth conference of the School of Mamluk Studies at Ghent University, in collaboration with the Ghent Centre for Digital Humanities (July 2-4, 2018). The course will be demanding and hands-on in its format, but no previous training is required. The course will cover topics such as digitization, computational analysis, datamodeling, etc., and will introduce digital tools, projects, repositories and practices that are currently available for historical/Islamic/Mamluk research.

The first day of the conference, July 5, will be themed. The theme of this part of the conference will be Historiography/Adab.
